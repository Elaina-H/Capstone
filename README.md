# Capstone
## Goal
Our group wanted to make an educational tool for students that combined the functions of existing productivity management concepts into a single streamlined interface. Students are tired of swapping back and forth on their personal calendar, schedular, to-do list, email, agile timeline, etc. The differences between platforms also makes swapping back and forth a headache. We wanted to make a UI that was simple and consistent for all of these tools. We also had a development goal of making a site that was scalable and collaborative, so that more than one person could work on features and those features could be added or removed without breaking the rest of the components (excluding the calendar).
