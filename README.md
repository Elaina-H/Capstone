# Capstone
## Goal
Our group wanted to make an educational tool for students that combined the functions of existing productivity management concepts into a single streamlined interface. Students are tired of swapping back and forth on their personal calendar, schedular, to-do list, email, agile timeline, etc. The differences between platforms also make swapping back and forth a headache. We wanted to make a UI that was simple and consistent for all of these tools. We also had a development goal of making a site that was scalable and collaborative, so that more than one person could work on features and those features could be added or removed without breaking the rest of the components (excluding the calendar). 
## Functional Requirements
- Calendar
- To-Do List
- Visualization of To-Do List Dependancies
- List of Available Study Rooms in Edmon Low Library
## Non-Functional Requirements
- Password-Protected secure room
- Collaboration for up to 10 people
## View Project
- https://groupwork.live
## Post-Semester Additions
- Fully deployed project to an external domain to allow easier demonstration and use.
- Migrated database from Azure to mySQL
- Migrated SQL database to a secure private server to allow access at any time.
- Improved state management through react to make it easier to add components and ensure proper display of events.
## Future Goals
- Add additional functions to the site, including chat posts and a group scheduler.
- Enhance security
- Track user log-ins to remember their rooms for them and allow access without the code
- Allow users to be assigned to tasks in to-do list
- Enable notifications for users
## Current Bugs to fix
- To-do list visualization saves to local storage rather than database
- Log-in page having issues after deployment and needs to be reworked
- Study Rooms on seperate server from backend and not publicly deployed for access from domain
